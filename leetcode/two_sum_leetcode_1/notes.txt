Explanation:
For each element in the list, what we are looking for is the difference
between the target and the element. The moment you find the difference
for a particular element in the hash map, you have found the solution.
You can then return the index of the current element and the index of the
difference in the hash map

Algorithm:
Use a Hash map to store the values and their index in the list
Before you store every value in the hash map, subtract the value from the target

Check if the difference from subtracting is the hash map
if the difference is in the hash map, return the index of that difference and
the index of the current element you are on

if the difference is not in the hash map, store the current element
as key and its index as value in the hash map

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list which is hash map
