Solution Explanation:


Algorithm:
- Store the seven different roman numerals as keys in a dictionary and their
integer as values
- Create a variable to store the result of roman conversion and set it to 0
- Loop through the list and for each element in the index:
    - Check if the index of the number infront of it is less than the length of
    the list and also if the number is less than the one if front of it.
    - If it is less than the number in front of it, subtract the number from
      the result
    - Else add the number to the result
- Return the result

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(1) -> You do not need an extra space
