Solution Explanation:
You will first have to find the range of the N value which is the length
of the list given including itself.
Afterwards, you will get every number in the range of N and check if it is
the list you have been given or not.
If it is not in the list you've been given, return the first number you
encounter which is not in the list

Algorithm:
Use a for loop to go through the range of the length of the list plus 1
Check if the current index is not in the given array
If the current index is not in the given array, return the index as the number missing

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once in the range of N(length of list)
Space complexity: O(1) -> You won't need any extra space
