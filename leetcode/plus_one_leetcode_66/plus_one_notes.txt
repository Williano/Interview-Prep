Solution Explanation:
Convert the list of integers to list of strings and afterwards merge the list
of strings into one word. Then convert the word to integer and add one to it
Afterwards, convert the new digit to into a list

Algorithm:
- Convert the list of digit into a list of strings
- Join the list of words together as one string, covert the string to an integer
and add one to it
- Convert the new word into a list of integers by converting the digits into string
and for each character convert it into an integer and add to the list

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N^2) -> You have to check each element twice
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list
