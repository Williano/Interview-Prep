Solution Explanation:
You are looking for a number which appears only once in the list.

Algorithm:
- Return the first element in the list if the length of the list is less than 2
- Go through the list and for each element check number of times it appears in the
list.
If the number of times it appears is less than 2, return that number

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(1) -> You need an extra space to store the list
