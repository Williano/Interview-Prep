Solution Explanation:
You will print the tree level by level using a queue

Algorithm:
- Create a queue
- Add the root to the queue
- Create new list called level_order_traversal
- While the queue is not empty, dequeue element from it
- Create a new list to store the levels in it and call it levels
- Use a for loop to go through the queue, as long as there is data in the queue,
add append it to the new list
- Afterwards, for each element in the queue, check if it has a left, if it has
a left, enqueue the element to the end of the queue and repeat same if it has a
right element.
- Once you get out of the for loop, append what it is in the current levels list
to the level_order_traversal list
- Once there is no items in the queue, which onces the while loop breaks, return
the level_order_traversal list

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N^2) -> You have to check each element twice
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list
