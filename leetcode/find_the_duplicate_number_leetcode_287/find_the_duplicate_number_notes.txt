Solution Explanation:
Use hash map to store all the numbers and how many times they appear.
If you check and a number already exist in the hash map, return that number
otherwise add it

Algorithm:
- Check if the length is less than 2, then return the first element in it
- Create a hash map to store the numbers and how many times they appear
- Loop the elements, for ecah element:
    - Check if the element is in the hash map already, it is, return that number
    - Else add the number and set it count to 1

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list which is hash map
