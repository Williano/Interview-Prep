Solution Explanation:


Algorithm:
- Convert the phrase to lowercase
- Check if all the characters in the phrase are alpha numeric. Remove all the
characters that are not alph numeric. This is done to eliminate whitespaces,
question marks etc
- Check the new word with it's reverse, if they match, it is a valid palindrome.

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list which is hash map
