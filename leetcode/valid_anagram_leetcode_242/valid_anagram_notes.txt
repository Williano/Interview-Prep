Solution Explanation:
Anagrams have same characters and equal lengths.
So all you have to do is check if the two strings have same length and characters.
If they have same length and same characters, it is valid anagram otherwise it is
not.

Algorithm:
- Check the length of the two strings, if the are not equal, return False because
anagrams have equal length
- Check if both strings have same characters, if they have same characters, it is
an anagram


Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(NlogN) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list which is hash map
