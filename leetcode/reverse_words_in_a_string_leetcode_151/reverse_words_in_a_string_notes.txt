Solution Explanation:
Split the words into an array and reverse them. After reversing, join them
together using a whitespaces

Algorithm:
- Convert the words into a list
- Reverse the list
- Join the reverse list together using whitespaces

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list
