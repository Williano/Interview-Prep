Solution Explanation:
You are looking for a number which appears only once in the list.

Algorithm:
- Return the list if the length of the list is less than 2
- Create an empty list to store the new values that appear only once
- Go through the list and for each element check number of times it appears in the
list.
-If the number of times it appears is less than 2, add it to the new list
-If you get out of the loop, return the new list

Big O Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) -> You have to check each element once
Space complexity: O(N) -> You need an extra space to store the list
